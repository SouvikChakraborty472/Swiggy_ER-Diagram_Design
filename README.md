## Repository Contents

* **`product dissection for swiggy.pdf`**: This PDF document serves as the **business documentation file**. It details the in-depth product dissection of Swiggy, outlining its core functionalities, user roles, order flows, and various operational aspects that inform the database design. It's a testament to my ability to thoroughly understand and articulate complex business processes.

* **`swiggy business model.mwb`**: This file contains the **MySQL Workbench model** for the Swiggy ER Diagram. It visually represents the relationships between different entities within the Swiggy ecosystem, including users, restaurants, orders, menu items, delivery partners, and more. This model is meticulously designed to support the business logic identified in the product dissection.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on translating the intricate **business logic of Swiggy** into a structured and efficient database design. By leveraging my skills in **business analysis**, I've meticulously dissected Swiggy's operations to identify key entities and their relationships. The resulting ER Diagram is a critical component for any robust data management system, ensuring data integrity, scalability, and efficient retrieval.

The core objectives of this project were to:

* **Deconstruct the Swiggy Business Model**: Gain a deep understanding of how Swiggy operates, from customer ordering to restaurant management and delivery logistics.
* **Identify Key Entities and Attributes**: Pinpoint all relevant data points and group them into logical entities.
* **Define Relationships**: Establish clear relationships between entities, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.
* **Design a Scalable and Efficient ER Diagram**: Create a database schema that is not only accurate but also optimized for performance and future expansion.
